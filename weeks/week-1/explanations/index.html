    <h2>Let's learn some JS</h2>
    <h3>How to connect your HTML with your JS code ?</h3>
    <p>
      Let's start by adding a script tag right before our CLOSING body tag,
      make sure to add the "defer" attribute on the opening script tag.
    </p>
    <h3>What does the defer attribute mean?</h3>
    <p>
      In simple terms, the defer attribute within a script tag tells the web
      browser to load and execute the script after the HTML content has been
      fully parsed and displayed on the screen
    </p>
  </div>
  <!-- put at the end inside the body tag, to improve loading time -->
  <script src="1-basics.js" defer></script>
</body>
