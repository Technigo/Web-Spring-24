      <h2>ðŸ‘‰ Update array later in the code</h2>
      <p>When we use push() for arrays or update objects later in the code, I understand the point when we have 300
        indexes, but if we write this later in the code, doesn't this make the code cluttered and hard to read? Or
        should we write the changing code under the original array or object?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>ðŸ‘‰ push() vs .length</h2>
      <p>Why do we need parentheses after sort and not after length? Both are methods? When we put parentheses after
        length the code will broke but if we don't put them after sort it will broke. Shouldn't it be parentheses after
        both of them since they are methods?</p>

      <h2>ðŸ‘‰ Parameters in functions</h2>
      <p>Why do we need parentheses after sort and not after length? Both are methods? When we put parentheses after
        length the code will broke but if we don't put them after sort it will broke. Shouldn't it be parentheses after
        both of them since they are methods?</p>

      <h2>ðŸ‘‰ Method .map()</h2>
      <p>Can you please explain map()? It seems like an important functionality but I don't think it's been explained so
        far</p>
